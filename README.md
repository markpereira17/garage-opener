#**GARAGE OPENER**

##Controlling a garage using an ESP8266 Chip and a Relay


The purpose of this repository is to build a garage opener for me and my housemates to use to access the garage as we only have one
remote to open the garage and it would just be way cooler if we could open our garage from our smartphones. I'm trying to make this project as barebones as possible so it would be easy for people to acquire the hardware and get started. My version will be secure with user login and password however this public version will be wide-open for anyone to access. The languages which I am using are NodeJS, ReactJS and C.

```objectivec
$ git clone https://github.com/markpereira17/garage-opener

# Go into the repository
$ cd garage-opener

# Install the dependencies and run
$ npm install && npm start
```

> **Note:** This repository will be updated throughout the next 6 months as it grows and
I near completion. (19th September 2016)
